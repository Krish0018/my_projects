### Combined Cycle Power Plant
This project is base on the Linear Regression model of machine learning algorithm.
There are data records of certain processes in a combined cycle power plant and the lable is based on power output.
I've done some analysis on that data and try to get some relationship between features and lable to make a regression model for further prediction.
I've used to method to compare the output
One is Linear Regression and other one is Random forest Regression which is nothing but a group of Decision Trees.
Hope you'll find this helpfull and can suggest me to improve this too.

### Bank Marketing
This project is based on Classifier model.
There are different features are available in data defaults, different categories of clients with home loan etc.
And we have to predict that how many of them can pay the loan on the basis of previous data.
For this I've used Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier too.

### E-shop
This project is based on Unsupervised Learning.
This is based on the data of an e-commerce shop.
I've tried to find some clusters on the basis of records but the results was not that good.
Hope you guys will find something and also get back to me too.

### Iris Dataset
This project is based on K Nearest Neighbour model.
The data is not uploaded seperately because I've used it directly from pandas.
In this project I've tried to classify the species according to its nearest known species.

### Movie Recommender System
This is quite interesting project.
In this projects I've only used feature engineering and correlation method to make a movie recommender.
This is content based model.

### Twitter Sentiment Analysis
I've seen this project in one youtube video and i loved it.
This is something you all love to try.
There I used some special library like tweepy and Textblob.
There you should also know about NLP little bit and regular expression.
I didn't used any pre provide data..
I've created my developer account on twitter and then get api key and tokens and with the hep of them I can use any user's data.

### Text Mining
Well this purely NLP project.
I've tried it to learn more about processes in NLP on unstructured data like tokenization.
Again you will not find any data here seperately because NLP has lots of data in itself.
So you can get whatever the data you like.
