# Combined Cycle Power Plant
This project is base on the Linear Regression model of machine learning algorithm.
There are data records of certain processes in a combined cycle power plant and the lable is based on power output.
I've done some analysis on that data and try to get some relationship between features and lable to make a regression model for further prediction.
I've used to method to compare the output
One is Linear Regression and other one is Random forest Regression which is nothing but a group of Decision Trees.
Hope you'll find this helpfull and can suggest me to improve this too.
